				<p class="hp"> There is a slight correlation between a state's obesity rate and rate of disabled and not in workforce. There are a coupleoutliers that stand out such as North Dakota which has the lowest rate for disabled and not in workforce but a higher obesityrate. On the other end, Puerto Rico has the highest disabled and not in workforce rate but an average obesity rate. As expected,the majority of states that have a high obesity rate also have high disabled and not in workforce rates as seen with states suchas West Virginia, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Alabama.</p>
