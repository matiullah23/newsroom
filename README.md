My objective was to find a newsworthy issue about health risks facing particular demographics. The two variables I decided to find the correlation between are a state's obesity rate along with the rate of the adult population who are disabled and unable to work. The data was found using the 2014 U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and 2014 survey data from the Behavorial Risk Factor Survellance System. 

The data was visualized using JavaScript D3 techniques. The final webpage was a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
